It started exactly 4 years back and Microsoft was delaying it for long time. Finally on Nov 7, 2018 the request has been taken care and moved from &lt;strong>under review&lt;/strong> to &lt;strong>backlog&lt;/strong> status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Few days back we got our first beta version of the connector as well, with a warning&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Common Connection Name in Smartview Functions</title><link>https://blog.anbuchelva.in/hyperion/common-connection-name-in-smartview-functions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.anbuchelva.in/hyperion/common-connection-name-in-smartview-functions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another big gap from the previous post. I was being busy in the budgetting acitivities (which started in last Mar), as usual there were many change requests, allocation logic changes, etc., occupied most of my time. The budget is officially over and 2 forecast cycles are passed. So, I am free for sometime.&lt;/p>

There&amp;rsquo;s an option to setup Valid Intersection in PBCS. But, the requirement is to setup the same on premises environment.
You ask me how to do it in Microsoft Excel using VBA or Microsoft Access using SQL Query, I would do it very easily. But in Hyperion Planning, there&amp;rsquo;s no such option available inbuilt.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
