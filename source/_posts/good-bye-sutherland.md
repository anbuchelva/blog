I'm completing 8+ years of journey with [Sutherland](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sutherland-global-services) today, which is the longest stint of my career in any organization. It looks like I have spent a long period here, but feels like very short period. I would say that,



{% cq %} Time passes faster when we are happy and satisfied! {% endcq %}



I was part of two different roles both were related to planning; the first one is  Manpower planning, manpower is the most important asset of an outsourcing company and the second one is financial planning using Hyperion Platform, which is crucial than the first one.

I was hired by [Kannan M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kannan-meenakshi-sundaram-56a16a1/) and was reporting to [Palaniyappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/palaniyappan-subramanian-864a8816/) in the initial period.  I learnt how to exactly read data and make projections based on the history. Then later the Manpower Planning team was handed over to [Pammi Rupesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pammirupesh/) when it became more dynamic.  It gave more confidence on the projections that I made and to grab opportunities to directly interact with the clients. I'm really thankful to them for the trust that they had in me and pushing me to achieve things.

There are important people who I interacted more during the Manpower Planning phase. I would like to mention them here as a token of appreciation: [Mithun Mukunthan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mithun-mukundan-27839a1/), [Angelina Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelina-michael-3060044/), [Muralidhur KV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muralidhur-katrapati-79578a7/), [Balachandar Selvaraj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balachandar-selvaraj-b31aa728/), [Balaji Selvanambi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balajiselvanambi/), [Rudra Gunaseelan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudra-gunaseelan-a32415b/), [Sukesh Telang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sukesh-telang-395a85108/), [Amit Bhan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-bhan-729a9313/), [Sandhya Rani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhya-rani-ss-4222148b/), who made my days easy.



I made few life time friends here specifically Muthu, Vinoth, Jai, Vijay, Riyaz, Ramky, Samy. It was fun working with you guys!



I am kind of person to see the results immediately. Planning manpower and seeing the results would take at least 3-6 months time.  I always wanted to work on technical side where I write code and see the results immediately. 



I got an opportunity to join the BI-EPM team. I was hired by [Kumari Umapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumariumapathy/) and was reporting to [Dan Gagnon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-gagnon-56b05249/). They mentored me to grow to this state as the learning in Hyperion Platform is steep and long.
