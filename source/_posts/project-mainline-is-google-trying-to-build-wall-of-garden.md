Google introduced Project Mainline starting from Android 10.  Google claims that project mainline benefits uses on 3 components.

1. Security
2. Privacy
3. Consistency

The simple way to explain Project Mainline is to push Android Security Updates through Google Play store, instead of android updates.

Its good to get security updates directly from google rather than from the OEMs who don't provide updates frequently (there are few exceptions like Essential) and keep the users vulnerable on published exploits.

There are reasons why the OEMs don't provide security updates frequently.

* **Device sold in less numbers than expected.** E.g., Xiaomi Mi4i - all the Xiaomi devices were provided frequent updates and at least 1 major android version update. But this one was left with lollipop version.
* **Less support from chip manufacturers.** E.g., Redmi Note 4 (Chinese version) vs. Redmi Note 4 (Global/Indian Version) - The Chinese version contains Mediatek and Global version contains Snapdragon SoC. The Chinese version released with Marshmallow and ended with the same version, whereas the Global version launched with Marshmallow and Updated till Pie; which is 3 major updates received for the device.
* **Skins.** Most of the OEMs release their phone with heavily modified skins, which require additional time and effort to release an update.
* **More Devices less updates.** The OEMs sells different variant of devices to cover the higher end to lower end markets, which makes them difficult to release updates for each of the model. The companies that release less variants makes the updates faster. E.g., Pixel, Essential, OnePlus.
* **Kill support for old devices to force users to buy new devices.** What happens if the OEMs provide support for 5+ years old devices? An average user would use the device until it became dead. Most of the OEMs abandon support for the older devices and provide support ~2 years. Exceptions: OnePlus, Xiaomi.

So after all these, how we can use a device if it is more than 2 years old and keep up to date with security updates?

* Buy a device which has good developer support, E.g., Pixel, OnePlus, Essential, Xiaomi phones
* Switch to custom roms such as Lineage OS, once the OEM stop supporting the device. Users get at updates at least once in a month, if the device has good developer support.
* Make use of your phone's full potential.

What is with Project Mainline?

The title and all these above seems irrelevant to the topic. Isn't it?

Installing Custom ROMs have 2 or more components.

1. Installing ROM
2. Installing GAPPS
3. Magisk or other mods

If an user doesn't want to be tracked by Google, they just skip the 2nd option and uses Micro-G or vanilla android, as it is.

I'm not an android developer and I use android phones extensively. All these information shared here is my thoughts.
